# üñ•Ô∏è# IT Support Lab Project ‚Äì osTicket Helpdesk System

## Overview
This project demonstrates the setup of a functional IT helpdesk system using osTicket in a virtualized lab environment.  
It replicates a real-world IT support workflow where users submit tickets, and technicians manage and resolve them.

The goal of this project was to strengthen hands-on skills in virtualization, Linux server administration, networking, and IT support ticketing systems.

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Virtualization with Oracle VirtualBox (multi-VM lab setup)
- Network configuration and troubleshooting (Host-Only and Internal networks)
- Linux server administration (Apache, PHP, MariaDB installation)
- Database management (MySQL database creation and user configuration)
- Helpdesk operations using osTicket (ticket creation, assignment, and resolution)

---

## Lab Setup

### Virtual Machines
Three virtual machines were created and configured:

1. **Linux Mint Server** ‚Äì Hosted Apache, PHP, MariaDB, and osTicket.

### Network Configuration
- **Internal Network and Host-Only Adapter** enabled communication between VMs.  
- Static IPs assigned:
  - Linux Mint: 192.168.56.104
  - Technician VM: 192.168.56.101
  - User VM: 192.168.56.102
  
  Connectivity tested successfully using ping commands. </br>

## Installation Highlights

### Hosting Environment Setup
- Installed Apache, PHP, and MariaDB on Linux Mint.
- Verified PHP prerequisites required by osTicket.

### Database Configuration
Created and configured the database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE osticket;
CREATE USER 'osticketuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pass123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON osticket.* TO 'osticketuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES:
```

### osTicket Installation
1. Downloaded and extracted osTicket to /var/www/html/osticket.
2. Renamed and secured the configuration file: </br>
`sudo cp include/ost-sampleconfig.php include/ost-config.php` </br>
`sudo chmod 0644 include/ost-config.php`
3. Completed web-based installation, connecting to the configured database.

### Ticket Workflow
User Actions
 - Accessed `http://192.168.56.104/osticket` from the User VM.
 - Submitted a new ticket with issue details. </br>
